This is a copy of a page from SpaceX company website.<br/>
There is a video player (a spinning Earth) and a parallax-effect (a flying rocket) in it.<br/>
I use a <b>vidbg.js</b> library to create a video player (I installed an archive with it from GitHub, we need 2 files here: vidbg.js and vidbg.css). After installing it, I customize my player in main.js file.<br/>
To create a parallax effect, I use a <b>rellax.js</b> library (I install an archive again, but now only one file is required-rellax.min.js). I also activate it in main.js file and than I use data-atributes in index.html file to speed up/slow down the effect.
